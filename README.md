# Simple Weather Forecast (Bootcamp Challenge 6)

## Introduction and Purpose:

This was an exercise in the use of third-party APIs, using OpenWeatherMap.

## Scenario:

A fictional traveller wishes to view the weather outlook for multiple cities, in order to plan a trip accordingly.

## Technical Overview:

The application accesses weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, using a query string based on the user's input. It retrieves the weather data JSON, and formats relevant properties to be presented in the browser. Additionally, it automatically stores the user's city search history in local storage. 

## Results:

The application is currently live on [GitHub Pages](https://tadcos29.github.io/simple-weather-forecast/) 

The GitHub repository for the project is: https://github.com/tadcos29/simple-weather-forecast

## Potential Issues:

* The application uses standard browser alerts to generate error messages. This could be handled more elegantly with modals.

* The styling could stand to be more consistent.
